# Guess-Game
This is an implementation of a number guessing game that generates a number between the range of 1 and 2. The game prompts players for their username. Range is set as function parameter and the player is prompted to predict the generated number between the given range. At a correct guess, the game awards the player a point and moves them to stage 2 by increasing the maximum range value by 1, e.g. range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 till stage 10.
